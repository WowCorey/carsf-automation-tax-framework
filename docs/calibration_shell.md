# Calibration Shell

Status: V1.5 prototype calibration scaffolding.

## Purpose

The calibration shell identifies the datasets and review pathways needed before CARSF parameters could be calibrated. It does not contain real calibration values.

## Required Data Categories

Future calibration would require source categories including:

- ABS labour force and industry data
- ATO aggregated tax data
- PBO fiscal projections
- DSS / Services Australia payment data
- Fair Work / wage award data
- HILDA longitudinal labour data
- superannuation guarantee data
- HELP/HECS repayment data
- state payroll tax datasets
- industry productivity datasets
- business survey data
- Treasury modelling
- independent legal/tax review

## Placeholder-Only Fields

The calibration registry marks OPFTE_LIBC, FRV, QLC weights, AII weights, AAVA deductibility, caps, credit caps, uplift and rent-tax rates, safe-harbour thresholds, avoidance thresholds, transfer-pricing review shares, mixed-unit weighting, labour-market impacts, GST effects, superannuation and HELP/HECS effects, state payroll tax effects, regional weighting, public-sector automation, and investment deterrence as unresolved placeholder areas.

## Relationship to Mock Evidence

Synthetic mock evidence can test workflow states and confidence handling, but it cannot calibrate model values. A mock packet may demonstrate that a prototype requirement can be marked `partial` or `sufficient_for_prototype`; it does not provide a real OPFTE, FRV, cap rate, transfer-pricing share, or schedule setting.

## Investment and Incidence Calibration

The investment and incidence guardrails require future calibration before any policy claim:

- pass-through elasticities by sector and market structure
- worker wage or underemployment pressure estimates
- supplier pressure and capital absorption assumptions
- normal-return proxies by capital intensity and sector risk
- public-revenue coverage sensitivity and national automation fiscal damage
- over-capture and under-capture tolerances

No such calibration has occurred in this repository.

## Non-Claims

The calibration shell is not legal, tax, Treasury, ATO, ABS, Fair Work, OECD, BEPS, audit, forensic, or economic validation. It does not prove any model setting is correct.
